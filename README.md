## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning algorithm capable of classification from scratch. Classification algorithms have progressed to so far that they are now capable of safely driving a person to and from destinations. The Tesla self driving car has classification recognition software deeply embedded in its systems.


### Project Description
The dataset used for this project was the famous Iris dataset. The dataset consists of four features. Petal width and length, and sepal width and length. The dimensions are measured in centimeters to one significant figure. There are 150 observations.

K-means clustering algorithms are created from scratch to enable classification of the dataset. When the features are plotted, there are two blobs of clusters. One round and on its own, and another more distorted blob. The k-means clustering algorithm is implemented until the centroids update no more and a classification has been made.


### Objectives
- Use k-means clustering algorithms to classify points
- Identify iris species using data and algorthim


## Data Science Methodology

### Problem Formulation
Provide a means of classifying the Iris plant species using Python. An algorithm is constructed that can be applied in any classification scenario. This can be scaled up, to allow machine to classify or decide what they are 'looking' at.

### Data Engineering Methods
- Data Visualisation
- Machine Learning
- Classification
- Algorithm architecture


## Conclusions
The algorithm is tested on a small dataset and works perfectly. When applied to the iris dataset, it performs very well. The algorithm clearly classifies 3 distinct blobs of points. There are approximately <5 obnservations that are misclassifed from the green and yellow blobs on figure 5. This results in an accuracy of 97%.
